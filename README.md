This project provides a means to track what the user does over the day with the aim to improve time management and investment.
It's very easy to sink into an activity that is high reward and low value (such as videogames) and lose track of time. By recording and graphing the activities I hope to improve the users vuew if of how time is invested in each type of activity.

This is comprised of a Java backend (Spring + Tomcat) and Angular frontend.

Results so far: as you might imagine - it takes a lot of discipline to record long running activities every day. Need to thik about how to make that easier
